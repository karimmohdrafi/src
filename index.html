            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>In this project we identified the moisture content was analyzed for the potato 
                peels powder by using solid state fermentation process. The moisture content 
                was founded 6.35% in potato peel powder. The pH of ethanol increases in 
                concentration potato peels powder and lies between 4.3 to 5.8</p>

            <h3>Biosorptive removal of dyes by using water hyacinth leaf</h3>
            <p>In this project we analysis water hyacinth is a free floating plant and best 
                adsorbent on the basis of removing dye and harmful pathogenic bacteria. At 
                350 and 700 degree Celsius the contact time for the complete removal of dye 
                was 60 minutes.</p>
